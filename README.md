# 🔍 LangChain Data Ingestion & Text Splitting for RAG Pipelines

This repository demonstrates the core components of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain). The focus is on **data ingestion** and **text splitting**, which are essential for preparing documents for semantic search and question-answering applications.

## 🚀 Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid NLP architecture that combines:
- Information retrieval from a knowledge base (vector store)
- Large Language Model (LLM) generation using retrieved data

To enable this, we first need to ingest documents, clean and split them, and store them efficiently. This project focuses on:

✅ Document ingestion (text, PDFs, XML, etc.)  
✅ Text splitting using LangChain’s utilities  
✅ Preparing the documents for downstream use in vector databases or retrieval systems.
